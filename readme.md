### Note Regarding Repo Architecture
Over the course of the semester we had 6 Programming Assignments, PA[1-6]. However, PA1 was just introduction to cloud computing, so there was nothing to push there.

### Note Regarding Hard-Coded IP Adresses
In many of the files in this repo, there may be lines of code like:
```python
""" Something like this or similar"""
sample_api_call = requests.get("http://1.222.333.444:5000/API/version/response", payload)
```
For our purposes, we did not need to set up a persistent endpoint for vm interaction in the cloud, so the hard coded IPs are calls to the vm's IP I was using at the time.
